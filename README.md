## User Stories

## Notes

I am using a different version of XCode, so some of the features are different than in the walkthrough video. I had to completely delete my project and start over from scratch because things just weren't working. It took me a while to try to figure out the settings screen, and I still haven't figured it out. I will be emailing for help. Now I am going to be working on adding more functionality to my app.
